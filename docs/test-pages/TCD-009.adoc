= TCD-009

== Purpose

Verifying the primitive types and their working. This case is verifying the optional primitive fields by adding values. This is a simple happy path.

[NOTE]
This is a reverse engineered test case.

=== Tested requirements

REQ-TYPE-001

=== Used JSL model

xref:resources/Primitives.jsl[Primitives.jsl]

== Test scenario

. Create and save MyEntityWithOptionalFields with these attributes:
    * integerAttr = 1;
    * scaledAttr = 1.23;
    * stringAttr = "test";
    * regexAttr = "+36 333-333-3333";
    * boolAttr = true;
    * dateAttr = "2022.07.11";
    * timestampAttr = "2022-07-11T19:09:33Z";
    * timeAttr = "23:59:59";
    * binaryAttr = File(xref:resources/test.txt[test.txt]);
    * enumAttr = MyEnum#Bombastic;

. Read from the database the instance of MyEntityWithOptionalFields that saved in the previous step (entity1).

. Check the next attribute values of the entity1. The values of attributes:
    * integerAttr = 1;
    * scaledAttr = 1.23;
    * stringAttr = "test";
    * regexAttr = "+36 333-333-3333";
    * boolAttr = true;
    * dateAttr = "2022.07.11";
    * timestampAttr = "2022-07-11T19:09:33Z";
    * timeAttr = "23:59:59";
    * binaryAttr = File(xref:resources/test.txt[test.txt]);
    * enumAttr = MyEnum#Bombastic;

. If there isn't any problem until this point and all attributes are the same as they were created, then the test is success.
