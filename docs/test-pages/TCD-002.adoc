= TCD-002

== Purpose

Checking that the IDE recognizes a file with .jsl extension as a JSL file.

=== Tested requirements

REQ-SYNT-001, REQ-MDL-001

=== Used JSL model

xref:resources/m1.jsl[m1.jsl], xref:resources/m1.txt[m1.txt]

== Test scenario

. Start the IDE (Eclipse or idea).

. Open the xref:resources/m1.txt[m1.txt].

. Verify that the IDE doesn't color the text, because it recognizes the file as a simple text file.

. Open the xref:resources/m1.jsl[m1.jsl].

. Verify that the IDE colours the text, because it handles the file as a standard JSL file.

. Goto the end of the file, and write in a new line the "ent" string, and press the CTRL + SPACE keys on the keyboard.

. The editor complements the "ent" to "entity" and colours it as a keyword.

. Close both file, and do not save them.

. If there isn't any problem until this point the test is success.
