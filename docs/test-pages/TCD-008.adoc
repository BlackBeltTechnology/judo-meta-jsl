= TCD-008

== Purpose

Verifying the primitive types and their working. This case is verifying the optional primitive fields without adding any values to them.

[NOTE]
This is a reverse engineered test case.

=== Tested requirements

REQ-TYPE-001

=== Used JSL model

xref:resources/Primitives.jsl[Primitives.jsl]

== Test scenario

. Create and save MyEntityWithOptionalFields without adding any attribute value.

. Read from the database the instance of MyEntityWithOptionalFields that saved in the previous step (entity1).

. Check the next attribute values of the entity1. None of them has any value.
    * integerAttr = empty;
    * scaledAttr = empty;
    * stringAttr = empty;
    * regexAttr = empty;
    * boolAttr = empty;
    * dateAttr = empty;
    * timestampAttr = empty;
    * timeAttr = empty;
    * binaryAttr = empty;
    * enumAttr = empty;

. If there isn't any problem until this point and none of attribute has any value the test is success.
